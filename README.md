A simple implementation of the A* algorithm based on Best-First-Search from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach(4th ed pg 77 Fig 3.9)*

The problem is a grid of locations with a starting location and a goal location.
In addition, certain locations can be blocked.

The A* algorithm attempts to find a path from the starting location to the goal location.

The algorithm has a simple heuristic of the factoring in the euclidean distance between the current location and the goal location.

TODO: Create a GUI to display the grid and the path.
