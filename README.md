A simple implementation of the A* algorithm based on Best-First-Search from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach(4th ed pg 73 Fig 3.7)*

- The problem is a 2d grid of locations with a starting location and a goal location. 

- Certain locations on the grid can be blocked, where the algorithm can not path on them.

- The A* algorithm attempts to find a path from the starting location to the goal location.

- The algorithm implements a simple heuristic of factoring in the euclidean distance between the current location and the goal location.

TODO: Create a GUI to display the grid and the path.
